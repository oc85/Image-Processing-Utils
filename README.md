# Deep learning method for mamalian images segmentation


This pipeline was developed for biomedical research support.

The final gode of the pipeline is textural/morphological feature extraction based on specific information in order to estimate degrative behaviour of the cells over time. 

The pipeline consysts of the following steps:
- image inhomogeneity correction using bilaterial ierative filtering
- pix2pix based segmentation
- ellipce fitting (external and internal) for selected cell
